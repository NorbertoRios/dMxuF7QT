<!-- 
TILT (103) On hardware with a three-axis accelerometer fitted, this event can be configured to
occur when a parked vehicle is tilted (e.g. being towed). See the accelerometer
application note.

SBD (104) The GNX attempted to send a location via the Iridium Short Burst Data modem.
105-reserved
INTFC(106) On GNX devices equipped with some Ublox GSM/HSPA modems this event
signifies that the modem has detected interference that is preventing a data
connection (.77 firmware and newer).

IPSUM (107) Input summary event: gives summary of action on the ignition and PTO inputs since

the last event. Can be a useful daily summary of activity.
See Input Summary Event (107) for more information.

GPSJAM(108) On GNX devices containing a ublox GPS receiver with software Version 7 and
above, this event will show if the GPS receiver thinks that the lack of position fix
may be for jamming reasons. Note that this can be prone to false positives.

TOW_START (110) See Parameter 113: indicates start of towing.
TOW_STOP (111) See Parameter 113: indicates end of towing.
TOW_EVENT (112) See Parameter 113: indicates ongoing towing.
TPERIODIC(113) See Parameter 112 (TEMP_INTERVAL). This is an optional event code indicating
that the server has enabled a temporary higher reporting rate from the GNX.
RELAY (115) Indicates that one of the relay drive outputs has changed state. Examine report

Column 79 (Relays). -->

<!-- CS440(116) An event was generated when data from the attached Bosch Rexroth CS440

Compuspread changed. Contact GenX for further details.

TAMPER(117) An event indicating a possible tampering with the GNX while the vehicle is parked.

Enabled by Parameter 177.

USAGE(119) Gxxx.08.xx and newer firmware: indicates that the GNX has reached its
MAXDATAUSAGE limit (only sent after the MAXDATAUSAGE has been
replenished).

BUS(120) Gxxx.08.xx and newer firmware: indicates a change in status of the connection to

the vehicle’s bus (J1939, OBD).

RPM_LOAD(121) Gxxx.08.xx and newer firmware: indicates a peak in RPM or engine load. -->
